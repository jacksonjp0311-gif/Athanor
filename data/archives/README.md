# Archives

Generated run records (created at runtime).

## Directory snapshot
```text
data/archives/
└── .keep
```

## How it works with the system
Every run writes a new `run_<timestamp>/` folder with ledger, metadata, stats, and optional visual artifacts.

> Keep this snapshot updated if seed files/placeholders change.
