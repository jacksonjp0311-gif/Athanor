# Test Suite

## Structure
- `tests/unit/` — fast, focused tests for core math and configuration validation.
- `tests/integration/` — end-to-end CLI/run-path checks and artifact assertions.

## Intent
The suite protects coherence semantics (ΔΦ → C → H7), runtime stability, and reproducibility guarantees.
