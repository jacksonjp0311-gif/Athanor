# Utils Module

Utility functions for logging, seeding, and artifact visualization.

## Files
- `logging.py` — JSONL logging helpers.
- `seeding.py` — RNG setup helpers.
- `visualization.py` — H7/fitness plotting and run dashboard rendering.
- `__init__.py` — utility exports.

## Role in coherence workflow
These helpers do not drive policy decisions; they improve observability and reproducibility so coherence behavior can be audited over generations.
